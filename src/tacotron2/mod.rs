//! Tacotron2 is a encoder-decoder sequence to sequence RNN model which predicts a sequence of mel
//! spectrogram frames from a sequence of tokens. These can be characters and the pre-trained
//! models provided are trained on characters, but they can also be phonemes. And while phonemes
//! provide more control over pronunciation, they require another stage between text processing
//! and spectrogram generation (g2p, dict lookup etc).
//!
//! Also, tacotron2 has been shown to do some interesting things with emphasis by getting users in
//! data collection to stress the capitalised word. So the character input is also case sensitive.
//!
//! This does add some complexity though, the nvidia pretrained model is trained only on lowercase
//! characters and punctuation. If you provide upper case characters or phonemes to the model it
//! will generate gibberish. You can work out the lowercase character part from the code, but not
//! the phoneme part (it is mentioned in a github issue or forum somewhere).
//!
//! If you want to learn more about tacotron2 here are some resources
//!
//! * [Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/method/tacotron-2)
//! * [Publication website](https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/tacotron2/)
//! * [nvidia
//! catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/resources/tacotron_2_and_waveglow_for_pytorch)
//!
//! This module primarily deals with
//!
//! 1. Tacotron2 inference, converting units to IDs, running networks, getting output
//! 2. Making the output usable
//!
//! The latter part is accomplished via small utility functions, things like getting a vocoder for
//! the model with the correct parameters to generate audio. If these parameters are wrong then the
//! audio will sound pitch shifted, like random noise or demonic nasal demons.
//!
//! Some things have been done quickly or within the code to try and keep things constrained to the
//! same file. In general I'd recommend every neural network come with some sort of config file
//! (json etc) which details things like these parameters, the IDs for the input/output and
//! relevant tensor names. This allows faster swapping of models if researchers are playing around
//! with different training or model setups. For keeping to one known architecture the returns can
//! diminish especially if you're not training your own model.
//!
//! # What's is an Encoder-Decoder Model?
//!
//! An encoder-decoder model is a sequence-to-sequence model, this means it maps from one sequence
//! to another sequence of potentially varying length. The encoder-decoder model is a specific
//! neural network architecture which allows this to happen.
//!
//! Traditional approaches worked well if the alignment between the input and output sequences
//! was known ahead of time and the order was the same for input and output sequence. The ordering
//! is the same for the sequences with TTS, but the durations aren't known. For each phoneme we
//! input the length of the audio for that phoneme may differ.
//!
//! The encoder part of the model will output some internal state which will typically be a vector
//! representation of the input, and other parameters that may be used to determine the output
//! sequence length. We can see in other TTS models the phoneme durations are output with a vector
//! representation, then the phoneme durations are used to determine how long the decoder runs.
//!
//! The decoder takes the state, then runs it through until completion. Often encoder-decoder
//! architectures maintain some form of count or End-of-Sequence token to determine when to stop.
//! Tacotron2 is a pre-transformers version of encoder-decoder, for each decoding step the encoder
//! output gets weighted by an attention module to ensure it progresses through the sequence and
//! doesn't get stuck. You can read one of the papers about this mechanism
//! [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.07503.pdf).
//!
//! If you're interested in more in depth explanations look for sequence-to-sequence learning and
//! LSTMs. You can see these architectures appear in other audio related tasks such as
//! transcription and also in machine translation. These areas as well as TTS will refer to a lot
//! of related foundational knowledge.
