//! The steps for speedyspeech were:
//!
//! 1. Download the latest model from [here](https://github.com/janvainer/speedyspeech/releases/download/v0.2/speedyspeech.pth)
//! 2. Convert to ONNX via my script in scripts/speedyspeech/onnx_experter.py
//!
//! Speedyspeech is similar in some senses to tacotron2 it's main components are:
//!
//! 1. A phoneme duration predictor
//! 2. An encoder network
//! 3. A decoder network
//!
//! The duration predictor is used to define the loop counts for the decoder, and this
//! internal variable dimension is something that is unlikely to work in most ONNX runtimes.
//! Instead what should be done to make it more exportable is splitting these three sub-networks
//! into three individual networks and figuring out the changes that need to be made to the decoder
//! network to do inference. This is the process that Nvidia did in the tacotron2 repo and
//! something I decided not to do myself as it would be a lot of time sunken into something that
//! might work poorly.
//!
//! If someones interested in trying that out, they can either adapt the speedyspeech repo, or
//! attempt to use something like onnx graph surgeon to mutate the graph I output. I have low hope
//! in adapting the repo however because...
//!
//! # Problems
//!
//! After getting our ONNX file however it uses the loop operator and
//! has dynamically sized inputs within the model. These are two things that
//! proved fatal to running it in a Rust runtime.
//!
//! After finding out about ORT I tried it there, unfortunately pytorch can output ONNX that
//! doesn't obey the standard (-1 dimension size in expand nodes). 
//!
//! There's an old version of torch used in speedyspeech, one with worse ONNX support. Any changes
//! to the pretrained graph would need to be done via this old version of torch and torch doesn't
//! come with a clear upgrade path. To run speedyspeech I would have had to port the code to a much
//! newer torch version and retrain a model from scratch.
//!
//! This is generally a painful part of ML when libraries like
//! torch or tensorflow are updated there's no thought given to the upgrade flow for users. I think
//! this is caused by the view that once a piece of research is published it's often pushed to github and
//! abandoned in favour of the next project. Any changes that require an update in torch version
//! would likely be new research and justify retraining from scratch which removes the need to
//! upgrade version.
